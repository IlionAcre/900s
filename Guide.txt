NONPROFIT FILING EXPORTER: USER GUIDE
========================================

------------------------------------------------------------
MODE SELECTION (Top Section)
------------------------------------------------------------

Choose how you want to search:
- SINGLE QUERY: For finding just one organization.
- MULTI QUERY: For processing a long list of organizations automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------
SINGLE QUERY MODE
------------------------------------------------------------

- QUERY: Type the exact name or a keyword for the organization you want to find.
- FOLDER: Where the finished spreadsheet will be saved. Click "Choose..." to pick a folder on your Mac.
- WILL SAVE AS: Shows you exactly what the filename will be before you even start.
- ALSO EXPORT FULL (UNCLEANED) FILE: 
  By default, the tool only gives you the most important data. Check this box if you want a second "Full" spreadsheet containing every single piece of information found in the tax filings.

------------------------------------------------------------
MULTI QUERY (BATCH) MODE
------------------------------------------------------------

- QUERIES FILE: Select the text file (.txt) or spreadsheet (.csv) that contains your list of names.
- FOLDER: Where all the results will be saved.
- BASE NAME: Choose a name (like "Project_Alpha") to help you identify the files created from this list.
- WAIT (SEC BETWEEN QUERIES): 
  Standard is 0. If you get blocked by the website, increase this (try 5 or 10) to make the tool search more slowly.
- BATCH:
  - QUERIES: How many searches to do before taking a "coffee break".
  - WAIT (MIN): How long the break should be (default is around 1 minute). 
  These settings are essential for doing hundreds of searches without being blocked.
- ALSO EXPORT FULL (UNCLEANED) FILES: 
  Same as Single mode; gives you the "unfiltered" raw data in a separate file.
- REPORT: 
  The name of the summary file (like "Daily_Status") that tells you which searches succeeded and which failed.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROXY (Optional - Multi Query Only)
------------------------------------------------------------

- PROXY URL: 
  Paste the full URL for your rotating proxy service here. This is usually provided by your proxy provider and contains authentication information.
  Example: http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080

- USE PROXY (Auto-Switch): 
  When checked:
  - Starts with direct connection.
  - Automatically switches to proxy if:
    a) You hit 50 direct requests/hour.
    b) You get 3 consecutive rate limit errors (429).
    c) Single query gets a rate limit error.

- FORCE PROXY (Always):
  When checked, the tool uses the proxy immediately from the very first request. Useful if you know your IP is already blocked.

- 3-STRIKE RULE (Automatic Protection):
  If you get 3 consecutive rate limit errors on direct connection:
  1. If proxy enabled -> Switches to proxy immediately.
  2. If no proxy -> Waits 1 hour to cool down, then retries automatically.

- AUTOMATIC FALLBACK:
  If 5 consecutive rate limit errors occur even with proxy, the tool will disable the proxy and wait.

------------------------------------------------------------
REQUEST COUNTER (Rate Limiting)
------------------------------------------------------------

The app tracks how many direct (non-proxy) requests you make per hour.

- DISPLAY: Shows "Direct: X/50 (resets in Xm)" in the bottom bar
- LIMIT: 50 direct requests per hour (website rate limit)
- AUTOMATIC RESET: Counter resets after 1 hour of no activity
- PERSISTENT: Count is saved between sessions

When you hit 50 requests:
- If proxy is enabled: automatically switches to proxy
- If no proxy: waits for the remaining time until the hour is up

This helps you avoid being blocked by the website while maximizing your request speed.

------------------------------------------------------------
SETTINGS (Saved Automatically)
------------------------------------------------------------

All your settings (folder, proxy URL, wait times, etc.) are saved automatically when you close the app. Next time you open it, everything will be exactly as you left it.

------------------------------------------------------------
BOTTOM CONTROLS & STATUS
------------------------------------------------------------

- STATUS BAR (Bottom Left):
  It tells you exactly what the tool is doing. If it's waiting, it will show a countdown (e.g., "Waiting 24s...") so you know precisely how much time is left.

- RUN BUTTON: Starts the process.
- STOP BUTTON: 
  If you click this, the tool stops immediately. It will cancel any active waiting timers and immediately save all the organizations it has processed so far.

------------------------------------------------------------
THE RESULTS (Check your "data" folder)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Spreadsheet (_990.csv): Final data for standard nonprofits.
- Spreadsheet (_990pf.csv): Final data for private foundations.
- Summary Report: A simple list showing the result of every query in your batch.
